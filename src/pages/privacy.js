      <h2>3. WHY WE MAY SHARE OR TRANSFER PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        In order to provide you with our Services and meet the purposes
        identified in this Privacy Statement, we sometimes need help from third
        parties, such as contractors, service providers, agencies and other
        business partners. As such, your personal information may be shared with
        these third parties and used only for the identified purposes. For
        example, we will share certain information with the Ministry of Health
        in order to meet certain regulatory requirements. Further, we may share
        information with collections agencies in order to collect a debt that is
        owed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Statys&nbsp;MD discloses personal information to third parties when
        required to do so in accordance with this Privacy Statement or by
        applicable law. Examples of situations in which we may disclose personal
        information include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          to respond to a subpoena, warrant, court order or other legal request
          with appropriate jurisdiction
        </li>
        <li>
          to business partners and third parties in connection with the
          evaluation of, or the completion of a sale, merger, consolidation,
          change in control, transfer of assets, bankruptcy, reorganization, or
          liquidation
        </li>
        <li>
          to take action regarding illegal activities or violations of our terms
          and conditions of business; or
        </li>
        <li>as otherwise required or permitted by law.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>4. HOW WE PROTECT AND RETAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        The security of the personal information under our control is important
        to us. Statys&nbsp;MD uses organizational, technical and physical

        securing work areas, restricting access to information to only
        authorized individuals, using encryption programs and other security
        measures to protect our networks and databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Statys&nbsp;MD uses third parties service providers, Statys&nbsp;MD
        requires such service providers to use similar safeguards to those used
        by Statys MD, and also requires service providers to limit access to
        your personal information and to keep it strictly confidential. Service
        providers are only permitted to use your personal information for the
        sole purpose of carrying out services on behalf of Statys&nbsp;MD.
      </p>

        necessary or relevant for the purposes we have identified or as required
        by law Your personal information is stored and/or processed or otherwise
        used by or on behalf of Statys&nbsp;MD inside of Canada. However, one or
        more of our partners or service providers may be located in another
